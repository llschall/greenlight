# trafficlight
This app is used to display a traffic light signal which reflects the current traffic light model. It polls periodically a URL to update its model and then sends a message through serial communication that reflects the current model state to an Arduino board connected to a USB to switch on/off hardware traffic light signal LEDs.

This project is in direct relation with RedLight(https://github.com/ssenegas/RedLight) project.
